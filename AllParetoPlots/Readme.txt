Readme: 

- Within each circuit folder are individual cases of promoter leakiness in circuit architecture. 
Each of these subfolders contains images of Pareto fronts and their corresponding parameters in sensitivity space. 

- For "Double Negative", "Double Positive" and "Positive Negative" feedback architectures, the "No Leak" subfolder only contains plots of parameter space because their respective Pareto fronts in sensitivity space are already displayed in the Supplementary Information of the paper. 

- In the figure file names, SS1 and SS2 refer to the first and second steady states of the system of interest. If only files named with SS1 are present, then the system either only has a second steady state or the Pareto front (and hence corresponding parameters) are identical for both steady states --- ie. the Pareto optimal points occurs when the system exists in a state with only a single steady prior to bifurcation. As an example of the latter, Circuit8D has both SS1 and SS2 plots included but they are identical (meaning the SS1 set of plots alone was sufficient).
